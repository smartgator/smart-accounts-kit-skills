# 🦊 MetaMask Smart Accounts Kit Skill

An [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) agent skill for building Web3 applications with the MetaMask Smart Accounts Kit.

## What's This?

This skill gives your AI agent deep knowledge of:

- **ERC-4337 Smart Accounts** — Programmable wallets with recovery, multisig, and batched transactions
- **Delegation Framework (ERC-7710)** — Grant scoped permissions with caveats and restrictions
- **Advanced Permissions (ERC-7715)** — Request permissions through MetaMask with human-readable confirmations
- **Gas Abstraction** — Paymasters, gasless transactions, pay fees in any token

## Installation

### Via ClawHub (easiest)

```bash
clawhub install smart-accounts-kit
```

### Via Git

```bash
cd ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills
git clone https://github.com/smartgator/smart-accounts-kit-skills.git
```

### Manual

Download and extract to your OpenClaw skills directory.

## Usage

Once installed, your OpenClaw agent can help you:

- Create and deploy smart accounts (Hybrid, Multisig, EIP-7702)
- Build delegation chains with spending limits and time restrictions
- Implement gasless transactions with paymasters
- Request advanced permissions through MetaMask Flask
- Write secure Web3 code with proper caveat enforcement

Just ask your agent about smart accounts, delegations, or permissions — it'll know what to do.

## Compatibility

- **MetaMask Smart Accounts Kit:** v0.3.0
- **Delegation Framework:** v1.3.0
- **Standards:** ERC-4337, ERC-7710, ERC-7715, ERC-7579

## Examples

Ask your agent things like:

> "Create a smart account with passkey support"

> "Set up a delegation that allows spending 100 USDC over 7 days"

> "How do I implement gasless transactions with a paymaster?"

> "Build a subscription system using periodic delegations"
